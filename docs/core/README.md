# Ionic Core

The [@ionic/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ionic/core) package contains the Web Components that make up the reusable UI building blocks of Ionic Framework. These components are designed to be used in traditional frontend view libraries/frameworks (such as React, Angular, or Vue), or on their own through traditional JavaScript in the browser.
