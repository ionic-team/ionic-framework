<h2 id="version-8x-dark-theme">Dark Theme</h2>

In previous versions, it was recommended to define the dark theme in the following way:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    /* global app variables */
  }

  .ios body {
    /* global ios app variables */
  }

  .md body {
    /* global md app variables */
  }
}
```

In Ionic Framework version 8, the dark theme is being distributed via css files that can be imported. Below is an example of importing a dark theme file in Angular:

```css
/* @import '@ionic/angular/css/themes/dark.always.css'; */
/* @import "@ionic/angular/css/themes/dark.class.css"; */
@import "@ionic/angular/css/themes/dark.system.css";
```

By importing the `dark.system.css` file, the dark theme variables will be defined like the following:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    /* global app variables */
  }

  :root.ios {
    /* global ios app variables */
  }

  :root.md {
    /* global md app variables */
  }
}
```

Notice that the dark theme is now applied to the `:root` selector instead of the `body` selector. The [`:root`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) selector represents the `<html>` element and is identical to the selector `html`, except that its specificity is higher.

While migrating to include the new dark theme files is unlikely to cause breaking changes, these new selectors can lead to unexpected overrides if custom CSS variables are being set on the `body` element. We recommend updating any instances where global application variables are set to target the `:root` selector instead.

For more information on the new dark theme files, refer to the [Dark Mode documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/dark-mode).

<h2 id="version-8x-global-styles">Global Styles</h2>

The `core.css` file has been updated to set the text color on the `body` element:

```diff
body {
+  color: var(--ion-text-color);
}
```

This allows components to inherit the color properly when used outside of Ionic Framework and is required for custom themes to work properly. However, it may have unintentional side effects in apps if the color was not expected to inherit.

<h2 id="version-8x-components">Components</h2>

<h4 id="version-8x-button">Button</h4>

- Button text now wraps by default. If this behavior is not desired, add the `ion-text-nowrap` class from the [CSS Utilities](https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/css-utilities).

<h4 id="version-8x-content">Content</h4>

- Content no longer sets the `--background` custom property when the `.outer-content` class is set on the host.

<h4 id="version-8x-datetime">Datetime</h4>

- The CSS shadow part for `month-year-button` has been changed to target a `button` element instead of `ion-item`. Developers should verify their UI renders as expected for the month/year toggle button inside of `ion-datetime`.
   - Developers using the CSS variables available on `ion-item` will need to migrate their CSS to use CSS properties. For example:
      ```diff
      ion-datetime::part(month-year-button) {
      -  --background: red;

      +  background: red;
      }
      ```

<h4 id="version-8x-nav">Nav</h4>

- `getLength` returns `Promise<number>` instead of `<number>`. This method was not previously available in Nav's TypeScript interface, but developers could still access it by casting Nav as `any`. Developers should ensure they `await` their `getLength` call before accessing the returned value.

<h4 id="version-8x-picker">Picker</h4>

- `ion-picker` and `ion-picker-column` have been renamed to `ion-picker-legacy` and `ion-picker-legacy-column`, respectively. This change was made to accommodate the new inline picker component while allowing developers to continue to use the legacy picker during this migration period.
  - Only the component names have been changed. Usages such as `ion-picker` or `IonPicker` should be changed to `ion-picker-legacy` and `IonPickerLegacy`, respectively.
  - Non-component usages such as `pickerController` or `useIonPicker` remain unchanged. The new picker displays inline with your page content and does not have equivalents for these non-component usages.
