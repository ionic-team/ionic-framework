### Components

#### Datetime

The `ion-datetime` component has undergone a complete rewrite and uses a new calendar style. As a result, some of the properties no longer apply and have been removed.

- `ion-datetime` now displays the calendar inline by default, allowing for more flexibility in presentation. As a result, the `placeholder` property has been removed. Additionally, the `text` and `placeholder` Shadow Parts have been removed.

- The `--padding-bottom`, `--padding-end`, `--padding-start`, `--padding-top`, and `--placeholder-color` CSS Variables have been removed since `ion-datetime` now displays inline by default.

- The `displayFormat` and `displayTimezone` properties have been removed since `ion-datetime` now displays inline with a calendar picker. To parse the UTC string provided in the payload of the `ionChange` event, we recommend using a 3rd-party date library like [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/). Here is an example of how you can take the UTC string from `ion-datetime` and format it to whatever style you prefer:

```typescript
import { format, parseISO } from 'date-fns';

/**
 * This is provided in the event
 * payload from the `ionChange` event.
 */
const dateFromIonDatetime = '2021-06-04T14:23:00-04:00';
const formattedString = format(parseISO(dateFromIonDatetime), 'MMM d, yyyy');

console.log(formattedString); // Jun 4, 2021
```

- The `pickerOptions` and `pickerFormat` properties have been removed since `ion-datetime` now uses a calendar style rather than a wheel picker style.

- The `monthNames`, `monthShortNames`, `dayNames`, and `dayShortNames` properties have been removed. `ion-datetime` can now automatically format these values according to your devices locale thanks to the [Intl.DateTimeFormat API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat). If you wish to force a specific locale, you can use the new `locale` property:

```html
<ion-datetime locale="fr-FR"></ion-datetime>
```

- The `open` method has been removed. To present the datetime in an overlay, you can pass it into an `ion-modal` or `ion-popover` component and call the `present` method on the overlay instance. Alternatively, you can use the `trigger` property on `ion-modal` or `ion-popover` to present the overlay on a button click:

```html
<ion-button id="open-modal">Open Datetime Modal</ion-button>
<ion-modal trigger="open-modal">
  <ion-datetime></ion-datetime>
</ion-modal>
```

#### Header

When using a collapsible large title, the last toolbar in the header with `collapse="condense"` no longer has a border. This does not affect the toolbar when the large title is collapsed.

To get the old style back, add the following CSS to your global stylesheet:

```css
ion-header.header-collapse-condense ion-toolbar:last-of-type {
  --border-width: 0 0 0.55px;
}
```

#### Icons

Ionic 6 now ships with Ionicons 6. Please be sure to review the [Ionicons 6.0.0 Changelog](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons/releases/tag/v6.0.0) and make any necessary changes.

#### Input

The `placeholder` property now has a type of `string | undefined` rather than `null | string | undefined`.

#### Modal

Converted `ion-modal` to use [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM).

If you were targeting the internals of `ion-modal` in your CSS, you will need to target the `backdrop` or `content` [Shadow Parts](https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/css-shadow-parts) instead, or use the provided CSS Variables.

Developers dynamically creating modals using `document.createElement('ion-modal')` will now need to call `modal.remove()` after the modal has been dismissed if they want the modal to be removed from the DOM.

#### Popover

Converted `ion-popover` to use [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM).

If you were targeting the internals of `ion-popover` in your CSS, you will need to target the `backdrop`, `arrow`, or `content` [Shadow Parts](https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/css-shadow-parts) instead, or use the provided CSS Variables.

Developers dynamically creating popovers using `document.createElement('ion-popover')` will now need to call `popover.remove()` after the popover has been dismissed if they want the popover to be removed from the DOM.

#### Radio

The `RadioChangeEventDetail` interface has been removed. Instead, listen for the `ionChange` event on `ion-radio-group` and use the `RadioGroupChangeEventDetail` interface.

#### Searchbar

The `showClearButton` property now defaults to `'always'` for improved usability with screen readers.

To get the old behavior, set `showClearButton` to `'focus'`.

#### Select

The `placeholder` property now has a type of `string | undefined` rather than `null | string | undefined`.

#### Tab Bar

The default iOS tab bar background color has been updated to better reflect the latest iOS styles. The new default value is:

```css
var(--ion-tab-bar-background, var(--ion-color-step-50, #f7f7f7));
```

#### Textarea

The `placeholder` property now has a type of `string | undefined` rather than `null | string | undefined`.

#### Toast

The `--white-space` CSS variable now defaults to `normal` instead of `pre-wrap`.

#### Toolbar

The default iOS toolbar background color has been updated to better reflect the latest iOS styles. The new default value is:

```css
var(--ion-toolbar-background, var(--ion-color-step-50, #f7f7f7));
```


### Config

#### Transition Shadow

The `experimentalTransitionShadow` config option has been removed. The transition shadow is now enabled when running in `ios` mode.


### Angular

#### Config

The `Config.set()` method has been removed. See https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/config for examples on how to set config globally, per-component, and per-platform.

Additionally, the `setupConfig` function is no longer exported from `@ionic/angular`. Developers should use `IonicModule.forRoot` to set the config instead. See https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/config for more information.

### React

#### Config

All Ionic React applications must now import `setupIonicReact` from `@ionic/react` and call it. If you are setting a custom config with `setupConfig`, pass your config directly to `setupIonicReact` instead:

**Old**
```javascript
import { setupConfig } from '@ionic/react';

setupConfig({
  mode: 'md'
})
```

**New**
```javascript
import { setupIonicReact } from '@ionic/react';

setupIonicReact({
  mode: 'md'
})
```

Note that all Ionic React applications must call `setupIonicReact` even if they are not setting custom configuration.

Additionally, the `setupConfig` function is no longer exported from `@ionic/react`.

### Vue

#### Config

The `setupConfig` function is no longer exported from `@ionic/vue`. Developers should pass their config into the `IonicVue` plugin. See https://ionicframework.com/docs/vue/config for more information.

#### Tabs Config

Support for child routes nested inside of tabs has been removed to better conform to Vue Router's best practices. Additional routes should be written as sibling routes with the parent tab as the path prefix:

**Old**
```typescript
const routes: Array<RouteRecordRaw> = [
  {
    path: '/',
    redirect: '/tabs/tab1'
  },
  {
    path: '/tabs/',
    component: Tabs,
    children: [
      {
        path: '',
        redirect: 'tab1'
      },
      {
        path: 'tab1',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab1.vue'),
        children: {
          {
            path: 'view',
            component: () => import('@/views/Tab1View.vue')
          }
        }
      },
      {
        path: 'tab2',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab2.vue')
      },
      {
        path: 'tab3',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab3.vue')
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**New**
```typescript
const routes: Array<RouteRecordRaw> = [
  {
    path: '/',
    redirect: '/tabs/tab1'
  },
  {
    path: '/tabs/',
    component: Tabs,
    children: [
      {
        path: '',
        redirect: 'tab1'
      },
      {
        path: 'tab1',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab1.vue')
      },
      {
        path: 'tab1/view',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab1View.vue')
      },
      {
        path: 'tab2',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab2.vue')
      },
      {
        path: 'tab3',
        component: () => import('@/views/Tab3.vue')
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

In the example above `tabs/tab1/view` has been rewritten has a sibling route to `tabs/tab1`. The `path` field now includes the `tab1` prefix.

#### Tabs Router Outlet

Developers must now provide an `ion-router-outlet` inside of `ion-tabs`. Previously one was generated automatically, but this made it difficult for developers to access the properties on the generated `ion-router-outlet`.

**Old**
```html
<ion-tabs>
  <ion-tab-bar slot="bottom">
    ...
  </ion-tab-bar>
</ion-tabs>

<script>
  import { IonTabs, IonTabBar } from '@ionic/vue';
  import { defineComponent } from 'vue';
  
  export default defineComponent({
    components: { IonTabs, IonTabBar }
  });
</script>
```

**New**
```html
<ion-tabs>
  <ion-router-outlet></ion-router-outlet>
  <ion-tab-bar slot="bottom">
    ...
  </ion-tab-bar>
</ion-tabs>

<script>
  import { IonTabs, IonTabBar, IonRouterOutlet } from '@ionic/vue';
  import { defineComponent } from 'vue';
  
  export default defineComponent({
    components: { IonTabs, IonTabBar, IonRouterOutlet }
  });
</script>
```

#### Overlay Events

Overlay events `onWillPresent`, `onDidPresent`, `onWillDismiss`, and `onDidDismiss` have been removed in favor of `willPresent`, `didPresent`, `willDismiss`, and `didDismiss`.

This applies to the following components: `ion-action-sheet`, `ion-alert`, `ion-loading`, `ion-modal`, `ion-picker`, `ion-popover`, and `ion-toast`.

**Old**
```html
<ion-modal
  :is-open="modalOpenRef"
  @onWillPresent="onModalWillPresentHandler"
  @onDidPresent="onModalDidPresentHandler"
  @onWillDismiss="onModalWillDismissHandler"
  @onDidDismiss="onModalDidDismissHandler"
>
  ...
</ion-modal>
```

**New**
```html
<ion-modal
  :is-open="modalOpenRef"
  @willPresent="onModalWillPresentHandler"
  @didPresent="onModalDidPresentHandler"
  @willDismiss="onModalWillDismissHandler"
  @didDismiss="onModalDidDismissHandler"
>
  ...
</ion-modal>
```

#### Utility Function Types

- The `IonRouter` type for `useIonRouter` has been renamed to `UseIonRouterResult`.

- The `IonKeyboardRef` type for `useKeyboard` has been renamed to `UseKeyboardResult`.


### Browser and Platform Support

This section details the desktop browser, JavaScript framework, and mobile platform versions that are supported by Ionic Framework v6.

**Minimum Browser Versions**
| Desktop Browser | Supported Versions |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Chrome          | 60+               |
| Safari          | 13+               |
| Firefox         | 63+               |
| Edge            | 79+               |

**Minimum JavaScript Framework Versions**

| Framework | Supported Version     |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Angular   | 12+                   |
| React     | 17+                   |
| Vue       | 3.0.6+                |

**Minimum Mobile Platform Versions**

| Platform | Supported Version                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| iOS      | 13+                                     |
| Android  | 5.0+ with Chromium 60+ (See note below) |

Starting with Android 5.0, the webview was moved to a separate application that can be updated independently of Android. This means that most Android 5.0+ devices are going to be running a modern version of Chromium. However, there are a still a subset of Android devices whose manufacturer has locked the webview version and does not allow the webview to update. These webviews are typically stuck at the version that was available when the device initially shipped.

As a result, Ionic Framework only supports Android devices and emulators running Android 5.0+ with a webview of Chromium 60 or newer. For context, this is the version that Stencil can support with no polyfills: https://stenciljs.com/docs/browser-support

### CSS

#### CSS Utilities

We originally added CSS utility attributes for styling components because it was a quick and easy way to wrap text or add padding to an element. Once we added support for multiple frameworks as part of our "Ionic for everyone" approach, we quickly determined there were problems with using CSS attributes with frameworks that use JSX and Typescript. In order to solve this we added CSS classes. Rather than support CSS attributes in certain frameworks and classes in others, we decided to remove the CSS attributes and support what works in all of them, classes, for consistency. In addition to this, changing to classes prefixed with `ion` avoids conflict with native attributes and user's CSS. In the latest version of Ionic 4, there are deprecation warnings printed in the console to show what the new classes are, and the documentation has been updated since support for classes was added to remove all references to attributes: https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/css-utilities.

Some examples of what's changed are below. *This is not all-inclusive, see the documentation linked above for all of the available CSS utility classes.*

**Before**

```html
<ion-header text-center></ion-header>
<ion-content padding></ion-content>
<ion-label text-wrap></ion-label>
<ion-item wrap></ion-item>
```

**After**

```html
<ion-header class="ion-text-center"></ion-header>
<ion-content class="ion-padding"></ion-content>
<ion-label class="ion-text-wrap"></ion-label>
<ion-item class="ion-wrap"></ion-item>
```


#### Display Classes

The responsive display classes found in the `display.css` file have had their media queries updated to better reflect how they should work. Instead of using the maximum value of the breakpoint for `.ion-hide-{breakpoint}-down` classes it will use the minimum of that breakpoint.

The [Ionic breakpoints](https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/css-utilities#ionic-breakpoints) are the following:


| Breakpoint Name | Width   |
| ----------------| --------|
| xs              | 0       |
| sm              | 576px   |
| md              | 768px   |
| lg              | 992px   |
| xl              | 1200px  |

Previously, if you added the class `ion-hide-md-down` to an element, it would hide the element when the screen size was `991px` (the maximum of the `md` breakpoint) or smaller. Now, using this same class will hide the element when the maximum screen size is `768px`.

Below is a table of how the media queries have changed for each class:

| Class Name          | Ionic 4                      | Ionic 5                      |
| --------------------| -----------------------------| -----------------------------|
| `.ion-hide-down`    | `@media (max-width: 575px)`  | all screen sizes             |
| `.ion-hide-sm-down` | `@media (max-width: 767px)`  | `@media (max-width: 576px)`  |
| `.ion-hide-md-down` | `@media (max-width: 991px)`  | `@media (max-width: 768px)`  |
| `.ion-hide-lg-down` | `@media (max-width: 1199px)` | `@media (max-width: 992px)`  |
| `.ion-hide-xl-down` | all screen sizes             | `@media (max-width: 1200px)` |

_Note that no changes were made to the `.ion-hide-{breakpoint}-up` classes._

See the [CSS Utilities responsive display documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/css-utilities#responsive-display-attributes) for more information.


#### Activated, Focused, Hover States

The `.activated` class that is automatically added to clickable components has been renamed to `.ion-activated`.

The way the CSS variables are used for targeting the activated, focused and hover backgrounds have been updated on the following components:

- Action Sheet
- Back Button
- Button
- FAB Button
- Item
- Menu Button
- Segment Button
- Tab Button

Previously, in order to update any of the background colors for the states you would have to know what the opacity was set to. Using the Material Design spec as an example, it would require you to know that the hover state uses a white overlay with an opacity of `.08`. This means that if we had the following set by default:

```css
--background-hover: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);
```

If you wanted to change the hover overlay to use black but still match the spec, you'd have to set it to:

```css
--background-hover: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
```

The new way adds the following variables:

```css
--background-activated-opacity
--background-focused-opacity
--background-hover-opacity
```

It also updates the Action Sheet component so that the variables will be prefixed with `button`. See the [Action Sheet](#action-sheet) section in this document for all of the new variable names.

This allows you to still have control over the opacity if desired, but when updating the state, you only have to set the main variables: `--background-activated`, `--background-focused`, `--background-hover` and the button will still match the spec. This is most important when changing the global theme, as updating the toolbar color will automatically update the hover states for all of the buttons in a toolbar, regardless of their fill and without having to know what each opacity is.


##### Examples

```css
/* Setting the button background on hover to solid red */
ion-button {
  --background-hover: red;
  --background-hover-opacity: 1;
}

/* Setting the action sheet button background on focus to an opaque green */
ion-action-sheet {
  --button-background-focus: green;
  --button-background-focus-opacity: 0.5;
}

/*
 * Setting the fab button background on hover to match the text color with
 * the default --background-hover-opacity on md
 */
.md ion-fab-button {
  --color: #222;
  --background-hover: #222;
}
```

##### Global CSS Properties

Some variables were renamed, removed or added. See the chart below for the changes.

| Old variable                            | Status  | New variable                              |
| ----------------------------------------| --------|-------------------------------------------|
| `--ion-toolbar-color-unchecked`         | renamed | `--ion-toolbar-segment-color`             |
| `--ion-toolbar-color-checked`           | renamed | `--ion-toolbar-segment-color-checked`     |
| `--ion-toolbar-background-unchecked`    | renamed | `--ion-toolbar-segment-background`        |
| `--ion-toolbar-background-checked`      | renamed | `--ion-toolbar-segment-background-checked`|
| `--ion-tab-bar-color-activated`         | renamed | `--ion-tab-bar-color-selected`            |
|                                         | added   | `--ion-toolbar-segment-indicator-color`   |
| `--ion-toolbar-color-activated`         | removed |                                           |
| `--ion-item-background-activated`       | removed |                                           |
| `--ion-item-background-focused`         | removed |                                           |
| `--ion-item-background-hover`           | removed |                                           |


#### Distributed Sass

The `scss` files have been removed from `dist/`. CSS variables should be used to theme instead.


### Components

#### Action Sheet

The following CSS variables have been renamed or added:

| Old                      | New                                        |
|--------------------------| -------------------------------------------|
|                          | `--button-background`                      |
| `--background-activated` | `--button-background-activated`            |
|                          | `--button-background-activated-opacity`    |
| `--background-selected`  | `--button-background-selected`             |
|                          | `--button-background-focused`              |
|                          | `--button-background-focused-opacity`      |
|                          | `--button-background-hover`                |
|                          | `--button-background-hover-opacity`        |
|                          | `--button-background-selected`             |
|                          | `--button-background-selected-opacity`     |
|                          | `--button-color`                           |
|                          | `--button-color-activated`                 |
|                          | `--button-color-focused`                   |
|                          | `--button-color-hover`                     |
|                          | `--button-color-selected`                  |

See the [Action Sheet CSS Custom Properties](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/action-sheet#css-custom-properties) documentation for descriptions.


#### Anchor

The `ion-anchor` component has been renamed to `ion-router-link` as this is a better description of which component it should be used with. This component should still only be used in vanilla and Stencil JavaScript projects. Angular projects should use an `<a>` and `routerLink` with the Angular router. See the [documentation for router-link](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/router-link) for more information.

#### Back Button

- Converted `ion-back-button` to use [shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM).
- [Focused, Hover States](#activated-focused-hover-states) have been updated.

#### Button

- [Activated, Focused, Hover States](#activated-focused-hover-states) have been updated.

#### Card

Converted `ion-card` to use [shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM).


#### Controllers

The controller components (`ion-action-sheet-controller`, `ion-alert-controller`, `ion-loading-controller`, `ion-menu-controller`, `ion-modal-controller`, `ion-picker-controller`, `ion-popover-controller`, `ion-toast-controller`) have been removed from Ionic core as elements. They should be imported from `@ionic/core` instead. This will not affect projects that use Angular or React. Below is an example of the loading controller change in a JavaScript project, but this change applies to all controller elements.

**Before**

```html
<ion-loading-controller></ion-loading-controller>

<script>
  async function presentLoading() {
    const loadingController = document.querySelector('ion-loading-controller');

    const loading = await loadingController.create({
      message: 'Hello',
      duration: 2000
    });
    await loading.present();
  }
</script>

```

**After**

```html
<script type="module">
  import { loadingController } from '@ionic/core';
  window.loadingController = loadingController;
</script>

<script>
  async function presentLoading() {
    const loading = await loadingController.create({
      message: 'Hello',
      duration: 2000
    });
    await loading.present();
  }
</script>
```

#### FAB Button

- [Activated, Focused, Hover States](#activated-focused-hover-states) have been updated.


#### Item

- [Activated, Focused, Hover States](#activated-focused-hover-states) have been updated.


#### Header / Footer

The `no-border` attribute has been removed, use `ion-no-border` class instead. See [CSS Utilities](#css-utilities) above for more information on why this change was made.


#### List Header

The list header has been redesigned to match the latest iOS spec. This may break the design of your application as the previous design had a small font size with uppercase text. The latest design includes a larger, bolder text.

In addition, any text content inside of an `<ion-list-header>` should be wrapped in an `<ion-label>` in order to get the proper styling of the new design. If the label is missing, the button alignment in the list header may look off.

**Before**

```html
<ion-list-header>
  New This Week
  <ion-button>See All</ion-button>
</ion-list-header>
```

**After**

```html
<ion-list-header>
  <ion-label>New This Week</ion-label>
  <ion-button>See All</ion-button>
</ion-list-header>
```

The button has also been updated to default to `fill="clear"` and `size="small"` when inside of a list header. If the old look of the list header or buttons is desired, use custom CSS or button properties to achieve it.

For more information see the [List Header usage](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/list-header#usage).


#### Menu

- The `swipeEnable()` function has been removed in Angular, use `swipeGesture()` instead.
- The `side` values `left` and `right` have been removed, use `start` and `end` instead.
- Removed the `main` attribute, use `content-id` (for vanilla JS / Vue) and `contentId` (for Angular / React) instead.

  **Before**

  ```html
  <ion-menu>...</ion-menu>
  <ion-content main>...</ion-content>
  ```

  **After**

  ```html
  <ion-menu content-id="main"></ion-menu>
  <ion-content id="main">...</ion-content>
  ```
- The presentation type in `ios` now defaults to `"overlay"`.


#### Menu Button

- [Focused, Hover States](#activated-focused-hover-states) have been updated.


#### Nav Link

The `ion-nav-push`, `ion-nav-back`, and `ion-nav-set-root` components have been removed in favor of using `ion-nav-link` with a `router-direction` property which accepts `”root”`, `“forward”`, and `“back”`. This reduces the need for maintaining multiple components when they all do the same thing with different transition directions. See the [documentation for nav-link](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/nav-link) for more information.


#### Radio

The `ion-radio` must be used inside of an `ion-radio-group` even if there is only one `ion-radio`. Additionally, the `checked` property has been removed. Developers should set the `value` property on the parent `ion-radio-group` to match the value of the desired checked radio button.

`ion-radio` no longer emits an `ionSelect` event. Developers should listen for an `ionChange` event to be emitted on `ion-radio-group` instead.

**Before**

```html
<ion-radio checked>One</ion-radio>

<ion-radio-group>
  <ion-radio>One</ion-radio>
  <ion-radio checked>Two</ion-radio>
</ion-radio-group>
```

**After**

```html
<ion-radio-group value="one">
  <ion-radio value="one">One</ion-radio>
</ion-radio-group>

<ion-radio-group value="two">
  <ion-radio value="one">One</ion-radio>
  <ion-radio value="two">Two</ion-radio>
</ion-radio-group>
```

#### Searchbar

##### Show Cancel Button

The `show-cancel-button` property of the searchbar no longer accepts boolean values. Accepted values are strings: `"focus"`, `"always"`, `"never"`.

**Before**

```html
<ion-searchbar show-cancel-button>
<ion-searchbar show-cancel-button="true">
<ion-searchbar show-cancel-button="false">
```

**After**

```html
<ion-searchbar show-cancel-button="focus">
<ion-searchbar show-cancel-button="focus">
<ion-searchbar show-cancel-button="never">
```

See the [Searchbar documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/searchbar#properties) for more information.

##### Inputmode

The `inputmode` property for `ion-searchbar` now defaults to `undefined`. To get the old behavior, set the inputmode property to `"search"`.


#### Segment

Segment was completely revamped to use the new iOS design including an all new gesture that applies for both Material Design and iOS. Due to these changes, some breaking changes were inevitably introduced in order to support the new design.

##### Renamed Events

`ion-segment` no longer emits an `ionSelect` event. Developers should listen for an `ionChange` event to be emitted on `ion-segment` instead.

##### Button States

- The activated styles and custom CSS properties have been removed. These are no longer being used in the latest spec as the indicator and ripple are used to show activation. Properties removed:
  ```
  --color-activated
  --background-activated
  ```
- The [Focused & Hover States](#activated-focused-hover-states) have been updated.

##### Indicator Color

- `--indicator-color` now applies to the checked segment button (for both `ios` and `md`)
- `--indicator-color-checked` has been removed
- The Material Design spec does not include an indicator color on non-checked buttons: https://material.io/components/tabs/
- In order to style the Segment to match the old spec, please use custom CSS. For example, to update Material Design to include a bottom line all of the time:
  ```css
  .md ion-segment::after {
      position: absolute;
      bottom: 0;
      height: 2px;
      width: 100%;
      content: '';
      background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
      z-index: -1;
  }
  ```

##### Background & Color

A `--background` variable has been added to style the `ion-segment` component. As a result of this, the following background variables for a child segment button must now be set on the `ion-segment-button`:

```
--background: Background of the segment button
--background-checked: Background of the checked segment button
--background-disabled: Background of the disabled segment button
--background-hover: Background of the segment button on hover
```

> Note: iOS no longer checks the button background, so setting the `--background-checked` variable may have an undesired outcome. Instead, Segment uses an indicator to slide between the buttons, showing which one is checked. See the previous section on the indicator color variables.

The above variables *will not* be inherited in the button if set on the `ion-segment`. In addition to this, all color variables should also be set on the button for consistency:

```
--color: Color of the segment button
--color-checked: Color of the checked segment button
--color-disabled: Color of the disabled segment button
--color-hover: Color of the segment button on hover
```

###### Removed variables

The following variables were removed due to the current spec no longer using them.

- `--color-checked-disabled`
- `--background-disabled`
- `--color-disabled`
- `--background-activated`
- `--color-activated`

##### Global CSS Properties

Some variables were renamed or added. See the chart below for the new names.

| Old variable                            | Status  | New variable                              |
| ----------------------------------------| --------|-------------------------------------------|
| `--ion-toolbar-color-unchecked`         | renamed | `--ion-toolbar-segment-color`             |
| `--ion-toolbar-color-checked`           | renamed | `--ion-toolbar-segment-color-checked`     |
| `--ion-toolbar-background-unchecked`    | renamed | `--ion-toolbar-segment-background`        |
| `--ion-toolbar-background-checked`      | renamed | `--ion-toolbar-segment-background-checked`|
|                                         | added   | `--ion-toolbar-segment-indicator-color`   |


#### Segment Button

The `checked` property has been removed. Developers should set the `value` property on the parent `ion-segment` to match the value of the desired checked segment button.

**Before**

```html
<ion-segment>
  <ion-segment-button>One</ion-segment-button>
  <ion-segment-button checked>Two</ion-segment-button>
  <ion-segment-button>Three</ion-segment-button>
</ion-segment>
```

**After**

```html
<ion-segment value="two">
  <ion-segment-button value="one">One</ion-segment-button>
  <ion-segment-button value="two">Two</ion-segment-button>
  <ion-segment-button value="three">Three</ion-segment-button>
</ion-segment>
```


#### Select Option

The `selected` property has been removed. Developers should set the `value` property on the parent `ion-select` to match the desired selected option.

**Before**

```html
<ion-select>
  <ion-select-option>One</ion-select-option>
  <ion-select-option selected>Two</ion-select-option>
</ion-select>
```

**After**

```html
<ion-select value="two">
  <ion-select-option value="one">One</ion-select-option>
  <ion-select-option value="two">Two</ion-select-option>
</ion-select>
```


#### Skeleton Text

The `width` property has been removed in favor of using CSS styling.


#### Split Pane
- Converted to use [shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM).
- Removed the `main` attribute, use `content-id` (for vanilla JS / Vue) and `contentId` (for Angular / React) instead.
  **Before**

  ```html
  <ion-split-pane>
    ...
    <div main>...</div>
  </ion-split-pane>
  ```

  **After**

  ```html
  <ion-split-pane content-id="main">
    ...
    <div id="main">...</div>
  </ion-split-pane>
  ```

#### Tabs

- [Focused State](#activated-focused-hover-states) have been updated.

#### Toast

The close button properties (`showCloseButton` and `closeButtonText`) have been removed. Use the `buttons` array instead with `role: 'cancel'`. See the [usage documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/toast#usage) for more information.

**Before**

```javascript
async presentToast() {
  const toast = await this.toastController.create({
    message: 'Your settings have been saved.',
    showCloseButton: true,
    closeButtonText: 'Close'
  });
  toast.present();
}
```

**After**

```javascript
async presentToast() {
  const toast = await this.toastController.create({
    message: 'Your settings have been saved.',
    buttons: [
      {
        text: 'Close',
        role: 'cancel',
        handler: () => {
          console.log('Close clicked');
        }
      }
    ]
  });
  toast.present();
}
```

### Colors

The default Ionic colors have been updated to the following:

```scss
primary:         #3880ff
secondary:       #3dc2ff
tertiary:        #5260ff
success:         #2dd36f
warning:         #ffc409
danger:          #eb445a
light:           #f4f5f8
medium:          #92949c
dark:            #222428
```

`primary`, `light` and `dark` have not changed. The contrast color for `warning` has been updated to `#000`.

This will only be a breaking change in your app if you are not using one of our starters and not overriding the defaults. If you are overriding the defaults already these will need to be manually updated if desired.


### Events

The `@ionic/angular` Events service has been removed.

- Use "Observables" for a similar pub/sub architecture: https://angular.io/guide/observables
- Use "Redux" for advanced state management: https://ngrx.io


### Mode

Mode is now cascaded from the parent to the child component. Previously, if you wanted to update a component and its children to use the same mode, you'd have to set it on all components. For example, if you wanted to use a `md` segment no matter the mode, you'd have to write the following:

```html
<ion-segment mode="md">
  <ion-segment-button mode="md">Button</ion-segment-button>
  <ion-segment-button mode="md">Button</ion-segment-button>
</ion-segment>
```

Now, the `mode` only needs to be set on the `ion-segment` and it will be inherited. If this behavior is not desired set a different mode on the child component.


### Ionicons

Ionicons 5 has been released! :tada: This brings many changes including a top to bottom re-draw of every icon, variants for each icon (filled, outline, and sharp), and the removal of auto-switching icons based on the platform.

For more information, check out the [Ionicons Changelog](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)!
