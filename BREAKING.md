<h2 id="version-8x-components">Components</h2>

<h4 id="version-8x-content">Content</h4>

- Content no longer sets the `--background` custom property when the `.outer-content` class is set on the host.

<h4 id="version-8x-datetime">Datetime</h4>

- The CSS shadow part for `month-year-button` has been changed to target a `button` element instead of `ion-item`. Developers should verify their UI renders as expected for the month/year toggle button inside of `ion-datetime`.
   - Developers using the CSS variables available on `ion-item` will need to migrate their CSS to use CSS properties. For example:
      ```diff
      ion-datetime::part(month-year-button) {
      -  --background: red;

      +  background: red;
      }
      ```
<h2 id="version-8x-picker">Picker</h2>

- `ion-picker` and `ion-picker-column` have been renamed to `ion-picker-legacy` and `ion-picker-legacy-column`, respectively. This change was made to accommodate the new inline picker component while allowing developers to continue to use the legacy picker during this migration period.
  - Only the component names have been changed. Usages such as `ion-picker` or `IonPicker` should be changed to `ion-picker-legacy` and `IonPickerLegacy`, respectively.
  - Non-component usages such as `pickerController` or `useIonPicker` remain unchanged. The new picker displays inline with your page content and does not have equivalents for these non-component usages.
