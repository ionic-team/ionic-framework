      # - run all the instances of the specified component(s) in the `src/components` folder
      # -- For example: if the `component` value is "item", then the following command will be: `npm run test.e2e item`

      # -- For example: if the `component` value is "item basic", then the following command will be: `npm run test.e2e item basic`
      # -- For example: if the `component` value is "src/components/item/test/basic src/components/item/test/a11y", then the following command will be: `npm run test.e2e src/components/item/test/basic src/components/item/test/a11y`

      # If the `component` variable is not set, then the test will run all the instances of the components in the `src/components` folder.
