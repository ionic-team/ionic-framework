      message: >
        Thanks for the issue! This issue has been labeled as `holiday triage`. With the winter holidays quickly approaching, much of the Ionic Team will soon be taking time off. During this time, issue triaging and PR review will be delayed until the team begins to return. After this period, we will work to ensure that all new issues are properly triaged and that new PRs are reviewed.
        In the meantime, please read our [Winter Holiday Triage Guide](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/22699) for information on how to ensure that your issue is triaged correctly.
        Thank you!

      message: >
        Thanks for the issue! This issue has been labeled as `needs reproduction`. This label
        is added to issues that need a code reproduction.


        Please reproduce this issue in an Ionic starter application and provide a way for us to access it (GitHub repo, StackBlitz, etc). Without a reliable code reproduction, it is unlikely we will be able to resolve the issue, leading to it being closed.


        If you have already provided a code snippet and are seeing this message, it is likely that the code snippet was not enough for our team to reproduce the issue.


        For a guide on how to create a good reproduction, see our [Contributing Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/contributing/how-to-contribute#creating-a-good-code-reproduction).
