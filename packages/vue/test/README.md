# Vue E2E Test Apps

Ionic Framework supports multiple versions of Vue. As a result, we need to verify that Ionic works correctly with each of these Vue versions.

## Test App Build Structure

Unlike other test applications, these test apps are broken up into multiple directories. These directories are then combined to create a single application. This allows us to share common application code, tests, etc so that each app is being tested the same way. Below details the different pieces that help create a single test application.

**apps** - This directory contains partial applications for each version of Vue we want to test. Typically these directories contain new `package.json` files, `jest.config.js` files, and more. If you have code that is specific to a particular version of Vue, put it in this directory.

**base** - This directory contains the base application that each test app will use. This is where tests, application logic, and more live. If you have code that needs to be run on every test app, put it in this directory.

**build** - When the `apps` and `base` directories are merged, the final result is put in this directory. The `build` directory should never be committed to git.

**build.sh** - This is the script that merges the `apps` and `base` directories and places the built application in the `build` directory.

Usage:

```shell
# Build a test app using apps/vue3 as a reference
./build.sh vue3
```

## How to modify test apps

To add new tests, components, or pages, modify the `base` project. This ensures that tests are run for every tested version.

If you want to add a version-specific change, add the change inside of the appropriate projects in `apps`. Be sure to replicate the directory structure. For example, if you are adding a new E2E test file called `test.e2e.ts` in `apps/vue3`, make sure you place the file in `apps/vue3/tests/e2e/test.e2e.ts`.

### Version-specific tests

If you need to add E2E tests that are only run on a specific version of the JS Framework, replicate the `VersionTest` component on each partial application. This ensures that tests for framework version X do not get run for framework version Y.

## Adding New Test Apps

As we add support for new versions of Vue, we will also need to update this directory to test against new applications. The following steps can serve as a guide for adding new apps:

1. Navigate to the built app for the most recent version of Vue that Ionic tests.
2. Update the application to the latest version of Vue.
3. Make note of any files that changed during the upgrade (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, etc).
4. Copy the changed files to a new directory in `apps`.
5. Add a new entry to the matrix for `test-core-vue` in `./github/workflows/build.yml`. This will allow the new test app to run against all PRs.
6. Commit these changes and push.
