### BREAKING CHANGES

* **toggle:** The `--background` and `--background-checked` variables have been renamed to `--track-background` and `--track-background-checked`, respectively.
* **types:** `ActionSheetAttributes`, `AlertAttributes`, `AlertTextareaAttributes`, `AlertInputAttributes`, `LoadingAttributes`, `ModalAttributes`, `PickerAttributes`, `PopoverAttributes`, and `ToastAttributes` have been removed. Developers should use `{ [key: string]: any }` instead.
* **vue:** `@ionic/vue` and `@ionic/vue-router` no longer ship a CommonJS entry point. Instead, only an ES Module entry point is provided for improved compatibility with Vite.
* **modal:** - The `swipeToClose` property has been removed in favor of `canDismiss`.
- The `canDismiss` property now defaults to `true` and can no longer be set to `undefined`.
* **accordion:** `ionChange` is no longer emitted when the `value` of `ion-accordion-group` is modified externally. `ionChange` is only emitted from user committed changes, such as clicking or tapping the accordion header.
