* **angular,angular-server:** angular v14 minimum support ([#26822](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/26822)) ([1dee16f](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/commit/1dee16f3a25dedf831afc09f9c400a42e861beea))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **searchbar:** The `detail` payload for the `ionInput` event now on `ion-searchbar` contains an object with the current `value` as well as the native event that triggered `ionInput`.
* **angular,angular-server:** Angular v14 is now required to use `@ionic/angular` and `@ionic/angular-server`. Upgrade your project to Angular v14 by following the [Angular v14 update guide](https://update.angular.io/?l=3&v=13.0-14.0).

The dev-preview `environmentInjector` property has been removed from `ion-tabs` and `ion-router-outlet`. Standalone component routing is now available without additional custom configuration. Remove the `environmentInjector` property from your `ion-tabs` and `ion-router-outlet` components.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **toggle:** The `--background` and `--background-checked` variables have been renamed to `--track-background` and `--track-background-checked`, respectively.
* **angular:** Datetime:

Passing the empty string to the `value` property will now error as it is not a valid ISO-8601 value.

Angular:

`null` values on form components will no longer be converted to the empty string (`''`) or `false`. This impacts `ion-checkbox`, `ion-datetime`, `ion-input`, `ion-radio`, `ion-radio-group`, ion-range`, `ion-searchbar`, `ion-segment`, `ion-select`, `ion-textarea`, and `ion-toggle`.
* **input, textarea:** The `detail` payload for the `ionInput` event on `ion-input` and `ion-textarea` now contains an object with the current `value` as well as the native event that triggered `ionInput`.
* **types:** `ActionSheetAttributes`, `AlertAttributes`, `AlertTextareaAttributes`, `AlertInputAttributes`, `LoadingAttributes`, `ModalAttributes`, `PickerAttributes`, `PopoverAttributes`, and `ToastAttributes` have been removed. Developers should use `{ [key: string]: any }` instead.
* **select:** `ionChange` is no longer emitted when the `value` of `ion-select` is modified externally. `ionChange` is only emitted from user committed changes, such as confirming a selected option in the select's overlay.
* **modal:** - The `swipeToClose` property has been removed in favor of `canDismiss`.
- The `canDismiss` property now defaults to `true` and can no longer be set to `undefined`.
* **checkbox:** `ionChange` is no longer emitted when the `checked` property of `ion-checkbox` is modified externally. `ionChange` is only emitted from user committed changes, such as clicking or tapping the checkbox.
* **accordion:** `ionChange` is no longer emitted when the `value` of `ion-accordion-group` is modified externally. `ionChange` is only emitted from user committed changes, such as clicking or tapping the accordion header.
