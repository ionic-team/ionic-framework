# @ionic/angular-server

Angular SSR Module for Ionic components.

## Known Issues / Trade-Offs

Before running the Angular SSR module for Ionic in production there are a few issues to become aware of. 

bug: SSR, Flickering when ssr page is replaced [#21394](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/21394)

bug: Address bar does not hide when scrolling [#19081](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/19081)

*^ Though this is not directly related to the SSR Module, if you are interested in SSR then you are likely catering to an experience in a web browser. In which case you should be aware of this trade-off in using Ionic + Angular for your PWA.*
