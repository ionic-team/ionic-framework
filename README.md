# Ionic Framework

[Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) is the open-source mobile app development framework that makes it easy to
build top quality native and progressive web apps with web technologies.

Ionic Framework is based on [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) and comes with many significant performance, usability, and feature improvements over the past versions.
