* **angular,angular-server:** Angular v14 is now required to use `@ionic/angular` and `@ionic/angular-server`. Upgrade your project to Angular v14 by following the [Angular v14 update guide](https://update.angular.io/?l=3&v=13.0-14.0).

The dev-preview `environmentInjector` property has been removed from `ion-tabs` and `ion-router-outlet`. Standalone component routing is now available without additional custom configuration. Remove the `environmentInjector` property from your `ion-tabs` and `ion-router-outlet` components.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **config:** The supported version of Firefox for Ionic v7 has changed to Firefox v70+
* **input, searchbar, select, textarea:** The default value for the `--placeholder-opacity` CSS Variable on `ion-input`, `ion-searchbar`, `ion-select`, and `ion-textarea` has been updated to `0.6`.
* **select:** The `icon` CSS Shadow Part for `ion-select` now targets an `ion-icon` component.
* **datetime:** The haptics when swiping the wheel picker are now enabled only on iOS.
* **toggle:** The `--background` and `--background-checked` variables have been renamed to `--track-background` and `--track-background-checked`, respectively.
* **angular:** Datetime:

Passing the empty string to the `value` property will now error as it is not a valid ISO-8601 value.

Angular:

`null` values on form components will no longer be converted to the empty string (`''`) or `false`. This impacts `ion-checkbox`, `ion-datetime`, `ion-input`, `ion-radio`, `ion-radio-group`, ion-range`, `ion-searchbar`, `ion-segment`, `ion-select`, `ion-textarea`, and `ion-toggle`.
* **picker:** The `refresh` key has been removed from the `PickerColumn` interface. Developers should use the `columns` property to refresh the `ion-picker` view.
* **input, textarea:** The `detail` payload for the `ionInput` event on `ion-input` and `ion-textarea` now contains an object with the current `value` as well as the native event that triggered `ionInput`.
* **datetime:** Datetime no longer incorrectly reports the time zone when `value` is updated. Datetime does not manage time zones, so any time zone information provided is ignored.
* **types:** `ActionSheetAttributes`, `AlertAttributes`, `AlertTextareaAttributes`, `AlertInputAttributes`, `LoadingAttributes`, `ModalAttributes`, `PickerAttributes`, `PopoverAttributes`, and `ToastAttributes` have been removed. Developers should use `{ [key: string]: any }` instead.
* **card-header:** - The card header has ben changed to a flex container with direction set to `column` (top to bottom). In `ios` mode the direction is set to `column-reverse` which results in the subtitle displaying on top of the title.
* **accordion-group:** Accordion Group no longer automatically adjusts the `value` property when passed an array and `multiple="false"`. Developers should update their apps to ensure they are using the API correctly.
* **select:** `ionChange` is no longer emitted when the `value` of `ion-select` is modified externally. `ionChange` is only emitted from user committed changes, such as confirming a selected option in the select's overlay.
* **react:** `@ionic/react` and `@ionic/react-router` no longer ship a CommonJS entry point. Instead, only an ES Module entry point is provided for improved compatibility with Vite.
* **vue:** `@ionic/vue` and `@ionic/vue-router` no longer ship a CommonJS entry point. Instead, only an ES Module entry point is provided for improved compatibility with Vite.
* **modal:** - The `swipeToClose` property has been removed in favor of `canDismiss`.
- The `canDismiss` property now defaults to `true` and can no longer be set to `undefined`.
* **checkbox:** `ionChange` is no longer emitted when the `checked` property of `ion-checkbox` is modified externally. `ionChange` is only emitted from user committed changes, such as clicking or tapping the checkbox.
* **accordion:** `ionChange` is no longer emitted when the `value` of `ion-accordion-group` is modified externally. `ionChange` is only emitted from user committed changes, such as clicking or tapping the accordion header.
* **core:** The `[hidden]` attribute has been removed from Ionic's global stylesheet. The `[hidden]` attribute can continue to be used, but developers will get the [native `hidden` implementation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/hidden) instead. The main difference is that the native implementation is easier to override using `display` than Ionic's implementation.

Developers can add the following CSS to their global stylesheet if they need the old behavior:

```css
[hidden] {
  display: none !important;
}
```
* **overlays:** Ionic now listens on the `keydown` event instead of the `keyup` event when determining when to dismiss overlays via the "Escape" key. Any applications that were listening on `keyup` to suppress this behavior should listen on `keydown` instead.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **searchbar:** The `showClearButton` property on `ion-searchbar` now defaults to `'always'`.
