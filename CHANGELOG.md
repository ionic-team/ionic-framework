### BREAKING CHANGES

> We recommend updating to the latest version of 4.x before trying out version 5 in order to see deprecation warnings related to your app [in the developer console](https://javascript.info/devtools).

*Activated Class*

The `activated` class that is automatically added to buttons on press has been renamed to `ion-activated`. This will be more consistent with our `ion-focused` class we add and also will reduce conflicts with users' CSS.

*CSS Variables*

The `--background-hover`, `--background-focused` and `--background-activated` CSS variables on components that render native buttons will now have an opacity automatically set. If you are setting any of these like the following:

```
--background-hover: rgba(44, 44, 44, 0.08);
```

You will likely not see a hover state anymore. It should be updated to only set the desired color:

```
--background-hover: rgba(44, 44, 44);
```

If the opacity desired is something other than what the spec asks for, use:

```
--background-hover: rgba(44, 44, 44);
--background-hover-opacity: 1;
```

### Breaking Changes

> We recommend updating to the latest version of 4.x before trying out version 5 in order to see deprecation warnings related to your app [in the developer console](https://javascript.info/devtools).

* **all:** mode is now cascaded from parent to child component. If this is not desired set a different mode on the child component. ([#19369](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/19369)) ([55462d7](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/commit/55462d7a0935f57b6855f9bd1bf788bfcf532bc3))

* **css:** responsive display media queries in the display CSS file have been updated. Instead of using the maximum value of that breakpoint (for `.ion-hide-{breakpoint}-down` classes) the maximum of the media query will be the minimum of that breakpoint. ([#18601](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/issues/18601)) ([40a8bff](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/commit/40a8bffcd54882300906243781abc12776c61ca6))

### BREAKING CHANGES

In order to speed up the build and reduce the main bundle size,
we have moved the ionicons outside the webpack build pipeline.

Instead, a new copy task needs to be added to the `angular.json`, specifically to the
the `"assets"` option of the `"build"`.

### BREAKING CHANGES

#### Core Components

Removes the `--width` and `--height` variables from the following components, in favor of CSS:

- Button
- FAB Button
- Checkbox
- Removes the `--width`/`--height` and adds a `--size` variable that is set on the width and height, allowing width and height to still be set and border-radius to still use it as a variable
- Radio
- Removes the `--width`/`--height` and `--inner-width`/`--inner-height` variables. Calculates inner values based on parent element size.

#### Overlay Components

The following components have all been converted to shadow (or scoped) and have CSS variables for width/height:

- Action Sheet _(scoped)_
- Alert _(scoped)_
- Loading _(scoped)_
- Menu _(shadow)_
- Modal _(scoped)_
- Picker _(scoped)_
- Popover _(scoped)_
- Toast _(shadow)_

The above components will now have the following CSS variables for consistency among overlays:

| Name |
| ----------------- |
| `--height` |
| `--max-height` |
| `--max-width` |
| `--min-height` |
| `--min-width` |
| `--width` |

If the component does not set the value, it will default to `auto`.

#### Removed CSS Variables

The following CSS properties have been removed:

| Component | Property | Reason |
| ---------------| --------------------| --------------------------------|
| **Button** | `--height` | Use CSS instead |
| **Button** | `--margin-bottom` | Use CSS instead |
| **Button** | `--margin-end` | Use CSS instead |

| **FAB Button** | `--height` | Use CSS instead |
| **FAB Button** | `--margin-bottom` | Use CSS instead |
| **FAB Button** | `--margin-end` | Use CSS instead |
| **FAB Button** | `--margin-start` | Use CSS instead |
| **FAB Button** | `--margin-top` | Use CSS instead |
| **Menu** | `--width-small` | Use a media query and `--width` |
| **Radio** | `--width` | Use CSS instead |
| **Radio** | `--height` | Use CSS instead |
| **Radio** | `--inner-height` | Calculated based on parent |
| **Radio** | `--inner-width` | Calculated based on parent |

#### FAB Button mini

Renamed `[mini]` attribute to `[size=small]` in `ion-fab-button`.

- <ion-fab-button mini></ion-fab-button>

### BREAKING CHANGES

#### [ANGULAR] Tabs

Tabs got the last bit of changes needed in order to support lazy loading of components. To support this, some changes are required for the router config. Using the tabs starter as an example, here's a diff of the changes:

<detail>

```diff
 import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';

 import { TabsPage } from './tabs.page';
-import { Tab1Page } from '../tab1/tab1.page';
-import { Tab2Page } from '../tab2/tab2.page';
-import { Tab3Page } from '../tab3/tab3.page';

 const routes: Routes = [
   {
     path: 'tabs',
     component: TabsPage,
     children: [
-      {
-        path: '',
-        redirectTo: '/tabs/(tab1:tab1)',
-        pathMatch: 'full',
-      },
       {
         path: 'tab1',
-        outlet: 'tab1',
-        component: Tab1Page
+        children: [
+          {
+            path: '',
+            loadChildren: '../tab1/tab1.module#Tab1PageModule'
+          }
+        ]
       },
       {
         path: 'tab2',
-        outlet: 'tab2',
-        component: Tab2Page
+        children: [
+          {
+            path: '',
+            loadChildren: '../tab2/tab2.module#Tab2PageModule'
+          }
+        ]
       },
       {
         path: 'tab3',
-        outlet: 'tab3',
-        component: Tab3Page
+        children: [
+          {
+            path: '',
+            loadChildren: '../tab3/tab3.module#Tab3PageModule'
+          }
+        ]
+      },
+      {
+        path: '',
+        redirectTo: '/tabs/tab1',
+        pathMatch: 'full'
       }
     ]
   },
   {
     path: '',
-    redirectTo: '/tabs/(tab1:tab1)',
+    redirectTo: '/tabs/tab1',
     pathMatch: 'full'
   }
 ];
```

</detail>

And for the tabs markup, we have something close to pre-beta 16 tabs, but still provides a custom tab-bar.


<detail>

```diff
 <ion-tabs>

-  <ion-tab tab="tab1">
-    <ion-router-outlet name="tab1"></ion-router-outlet>
-  </ion-tab>
-  <ion-tab tab="tab2">
-    <ion-router-outlet name="tab2"></ion-router-outlet>
-  </ion-tab>
-  <ion-tab tab="tab3">
-    <ion-router-outlet name="tab3"></ion-router-outlet>
-  </ion-tab>
-
   <ion-tab-bar slot="bottom">
-
-    <ion-tab-button tab="tab1" href="/tabs/(tab1:tab1)">
+    <ion-tab-button tab="tab1">
       <ion-icon name="flash"></ion-icon>
       <ion-label>Tab One</ion-label>
     </ion-tab-button>

-    <ion-tab-button tab="tab2" href="/tabs/(tab2:tab2)">
+    <ion-tab-button tab="tab2">
       <ion-icon name="apps"></ion-icon>
       <ion-label>Tab Two</ion-label>
     </ion-tab-button>

-    <ion-tab-button tab="tab3" href="/tabs/(tab3:tab3)">
+    <ion-tab-button tab="tab3">
       <ion-icon name="send"></ion-icon>
       <ion-label>Tab Three</ion-label>
     </ion-tab-button>
-
   </ion-tab-bar>

 </ion-tabs>
```

</detail>



### [ANGULAR] href does not cause Angular Router to navigate

For consistency sake, the `href` attribute of `ion-button`, `ion-item` and `ion-anchor` no longer
trigger navigation using the Angular’s Router,instead use angular’s `[routerLink]`:

```diff
- <ion-button href="/path/to/page">
+ <ion-button routerLink="/path/to/page">
```

This change will not affect SEO since ionic will still use `href` under the hood.


### [ANGULAR] Prefixed Ion- components

For consistency with other frameworks and the rest of APIs and tooling, the exported
ionic components are prefixed with `Ion`.

```diff
- import { Input } from '@ionic/angular';
+ import { IonInput } from '@ionic/angular';
```

This change might also help to improve autocompletion, and prevent collisions with other libraries.

### BREAKING CHANGES

Segment Button now requires the text to be wrapped in an `ion-label` element for improved styling.

*Old usage:*

 ```html
<ion-segment-button>
  Item One
</ion-segment-button>
 ```
 *New usage:*

 ```html
<ion-segment-button>
  <ion-label>Item One</ion-label>
</ion-segment-button>
 ```

#### Simplifying Chip

Because of updates to the Material Design spec, `ion-chip` no longer requires a chip-specific version of `ion-icon` or `ion-button`. Chips themselves should be interactive and don't require a nested button.

*Old usage:*

```html
<ion-chip>
  <ion-chip-icon name="checkmark"><ion-chip-icon>
</ion-chip>
```

*New usage:*

```html
<ion-chip>
  <ion-icon name="checkmark"></ion-icon>
</ion-chip>
```

## Rethinking Tabs

One of the most valuable and complex components in Ionic's toolkit is Tabs. Tabs started off as a simple component that would create a tabbed interface to allow users to switch between different views in a way that was consistent with native UX paradigms.

Over time, we started hearing people ask for more features to be added: "Can we have one tab button that is just a button?" "Can I customize how the tab buttons are displayed?" "Can I use a custom icon in the tab?"

Traditionally, these features, and many others, were difficult to accomplish because Tabs was doing a lot of magic behind the scenes to generate the Tab bar and buttons. With this in mind, we thought it was time for a refresh to offer as much flexibility as possible within Tabs.

In order to do this, we had to change how Tabs were written in an app. Prior to Beta 14, Tabs would look like this:

```html
<ion-tabs>
  <ion-tab label="Home" icon="home" href="/tabs/(home:home)">
    <ion-router-outlet name="home"></ion-router-outlet>
  </ion-tab>
  <ion-tab label="About" icon="information-circle" href="/tabs/(about:about)">
    <ion-router-outlet name="about"></ion-router-outlet>
  </ion-tab>
  <ion-tab label="Contact" icon="contacts" href="/tabs/(contact:contact)">
    <ion-router-outlet name="contact"></ion-router-outlet>
  </ion-tab>
</ion-tabs>
```

Here, we have an `ion-tab` element that accepts an icon, a label, and a link to navigate to as properties. This is pretty much how Tabs have worked all the way back to Ionic 1. In Beta 14, we've removed some of the magic from Tabs which allows for more customization:

```html
<ion-tabs>
  <ion-tab-bar>

    <!-- No ion-tab, just a link that looks like a tab -->
    <ion-tab-button href="https://ionicframework.com">
      <!-- <a href="https://ionicframework.com"> -->
      <ion-icon name="globe"></ion-icon>
      <ion-label>Schedule</ion-label>
    </ion-tab-button>

    <!-- No ion-tab, just a button that looks like a tab -->
    <ion-tab-button (click)="openCamera()">
      <ion-icon name="camera"></ion-icon>
      <ion-label>Photo</ion-label>
    </ion-tab-button>

    <!-- Connected to ion-tab, on click will show the ion-tab with id home-view -->
    <ion-tab-button tab="home-view">
      <ion-icon name="home"></ion-icon>
      <ion-label>Home</ion-label>
    </ion-tab-button>
  </ion-tab-bar>

  <ion-tab tab="home-view">
    <ion-content></ion-content>
    <!-- or -->
    <ion-nav></ion-nav>
    <!-- or -->
    <ion-router-outlet></ion-router-outlet>
  </ion-tab>

</ion-tabs>
```

There's a lot going on here, so let's break it down:

1. A single parent `ion-tabs` wraps the entire layout. Same as before.
2. A new element, `ion-tab-bar`, creates the Tab Bar which will contain buttons.
3. A new element, `ion-tab-button`, is used to create each button in the Tab Bar. These could be static links to different routes, buttons with click handlers on them, or link to whole tab views.
4. The `ion-tab` component becomes a separate container that has inline content (`ion-content`), a navigation component (`ion-nav`) or a router outlet (`ion-router-outlet`).

To connect the `ion-tab-button` to the `ion-tab`, the `tab` property must be added to both of these components. For example:

```html
<ion-tabs>
  <ion-tab-bar>
    <ion-tab-button tab="home-view"></ion-tab-button>
  </ion-tab-bar>

  <ion-tab tab="home-view"></ion-tab>
</ion-tabs>
```

Since the `tab` property is the same on the `ion-tab-button` and `ion-tab`, when the Tab Button is tapped, the `home-view` Tab will become active. This takes the magic out of Tabs while making the behavior between the tab buttons and the views much more explicit.

Some other benefits of this refactor include:

- Can now be written as a standalone Tab Bar (with no attached Tab)
- Works with a navigation component or a plain content element
- Works with shadow DOM and allows easy customization of the Tab Bar
- Gives full control over the elements inside of the Tab Bar
- Integrates nicely with other frameworks that have different ways of rendering element nodes

Lastly, this change also fixes some outstanding issues with Tabs, so we're excited to get this out to you all!
