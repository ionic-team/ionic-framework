# Ionic Design Tokens

## What are Design Tokens?

Design Tokens are an abstract and universal language to store Design System values, creating a single source of truth that is tech-agnostic and easily scalable and extendable for various outputs such as CSS, SCSS, iOS, Android, JSON, and more. Typically stored in JSON format, they facilitate seamless scalability for integration with any language or Design Tool like Figma or Sketch.

Design tokens represent small, repeated design decisions that make up a design system's visual style. Tokens replace static values, like hex codes representing colors, with descriptive and intuitive names.

## Design Tokens Architecture

The Ionic Design Tokens come from the [outsystems-design-tokens repo](https://github.com/OutSystems/outsystems-design-tokens). 

Using the [outsystems-design-tokens package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/outsystems-design-tokens), we use its `npx run build.tokens` to pass our configuration file, that will generate 2 files inside `core/src/foundations`:

- `ionic.vars.scss` - SCSS variables, based on the native ones, that are used internally on all CSS/SCSS code.
- `ionic.utility.scss` - list of utility classes based on each Design Token.

This refers, more or less, to what's known as System Tokens, which are decisions that systematize the design language for a specific theme or context.

Currently, Reference Tokens and Component Tokens are not used. Instead we are defining a base architecture for system tokens, that will inform the `:root` and global SCSS variables, and then we let the SCSS architecture propagate that to the Components.

## Format

The latest [W3C Design Tokens Format](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/) was adhered to, this is a recent effort to normalize the nomenclature of Design Tokens.

The nomenclature has the following structure: `type - type variation - modifier name - $value`

Example:

```json
{
  "color": {
    "$type": "color",
    "primary": {
      "10": {
        "$value": "#f7faff"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `index.js` script, on the scripts/tokens folder, is responsible for generating SCSS variables and utility classes, will follow the same nomenclature: `prefix - CSS property name - type variation - modifier name`.

Examples: 

SCSS Variable:

```scss
$ion-semantics-primary-300
```

Utility class:

```css
.ion-semantics-primary-300
```

## Managing the Design Tokens

It's not expected that the Tokens need to be changed frequently. This represents the base of all the Ionic Design System and any change to them should be taken carefully, synced with the UX/UI Team and reviewed by other devs. 

With the current architecture, this management is done on the [outsystems-design-tokens repo](https://github.com/OutSystems/outsystems-design-tokens) and updated its dependency here when necessary.

## How to use

It's very important to highlight that only the Ionic Theme supports these tokens and they should not be used for md/ios themes.

Within the component scope, variables from these global tokens should always be used. There should be no hardcoded values on component scope that relate to any of the existing tokens.

To prevent differences between components implementation, a global partial was created - `ionic.globals.scss` - that forwards all the necessary foundations, functions and mixins, relevant to the Ionic Theme.

Usage example (Chip Component):

```scss
@use '../../themes/ionic/ionic.globals.scss' as globals;

:host {
  --background: #{globals.$ion-primitives-neutral-100};
  color: globals.$ion-primitives-neutral-900;
  @include globals.font-smoothing;
}
```
