# ion-col

Columns are cellular components of the [grid](../Grid) system and go inside of a [row](../Row).
They will expand to fill their row. All content within a grid should go inside of a column.

## Column attributes

By default, columns will stretch to fill the entire height of the row.
There are several attributes that can be added to a column to customize this behavior.
