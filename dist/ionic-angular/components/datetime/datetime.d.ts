/**
 * @name DateTime
 * @description
 * The DateTime component is used to present an interface which makes it easy for
 * users to select dates and times. Tapping on `<ion-datetime>` will display a picker
 * interface that slides up from the bottom of the page. The picker then displays
 * scrollable columns that can be used to individually select years, months, days,
 * hours and minute values. The DateTime component is similar to the native
 * `<input type="datetime-local">` element, however, Ionic's DateTime component makes
 * it easy to display the date and time in a preferred format, and manage the datetime
 * values.
 *
 * ```html
 * <ion-item>
 *   <ion-label>Date</ion-label>
 *   <ion-datetime displayFormat="MM/DD/YYYY" [(ngModel)]="myDate"></ion-datetime>
 * </ion-item>
 * ```
 *
 *
 * ## Display and Picker Formats
 *
 * The DateTime component displays the values in two places: in the `<ion-datetime>`
 * component, and in the interface that is presented from the bottom of the screen.
 * The following chart lists all of the formats that can be used.
 *
 * | Format  | Description                    | Example                 |
 * |---------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
 * | `YYYY`  | Year, 4 digits                 | `2018`                  |
 * | `YY`    | Year, 2 digits                 | `18`                    |
 * | `M`     | Month                          | `1` ... `12`            |
 * | `MM`    | Month, leading zero            | `01` ... `12`           |
 * | `MMM`   | Month, short name              | `Jan`                   |
 * | `MMMM`  | Month, full name               | `January`               |
 * | `D`     | Day                            | `1` ... `31`            |
 * | `DD`    | Day, leading zero              | `01` ... `31`           |
 * | `DDD`   | Day, short name                | `Fri`                   |
 * | `DDDD`  | Day, full name                 | `Friday`                |
 * | `H`     | Hour, 24-hour                  | `0` ... `23`            |
 * | `HH`    | Hour, 24-hour, leading zero    | `00` ... `23`           |
 * | `h`     | Hour, 12-hour                  | `1` ... `12`            |
 * | `hh`    | Hour, 12-hour, leading zero    | `01` ... `12`           |
 * | `a`     | 12-hour time period, lowercase | `am` `pm`               |
 * | `A`     | 12-hour time period, uppercase | `AM` `PM`               |
 * | `m`     | Minute                         | `1` ... `59`            |
 * | `mm`    | Minute, leading zero           | `01` ... `59`           |
 * | `s`     | Second                         | `1` ... `59`            |
 * | `ss`    | Second, leading zero           | `01` ... `59`           |
 * | `Z`     | UTC Timezone Offset            | `Z or +HH:mm or -HH:mm` |
 *
 * **Important**: See the [Month Names and Day of the Week Names](#month-names-and-day-of-the-week-names)
 * section below on how to use different names for the month and day.
 *
 * ### Display Format
 *
 * The `displayFormat` input property specifies how a datetime's value should be
 * printed, as formatted text, within the `ion-datetime` component.
 *
 * In the following example, the display in the `<ion-datetime>` will use the
 * month's short name, the numerical day with a leading zero, a comma and the
 * four-digit year. In addition to the date, it will display the time with the hours
 * in the 24-hour format and the minutes. Any character can be used as a separator.
 * An example display using this format is: `Jun 17, 2005 11:06`.
 *
 * ```html
 * <ion-item>
 *   <ion-label>Date</ion-label>
 *   <ion-datetime displayFormat="MMM DD, YYYY HH:mm" [(ngModel)]="myDate"></ion-datetime>
 * </ion-item>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Picker Format
 *
 * The `pickerFormat` input property determines which columns should be shown in the
 * interface, the order of the columns, and which format to use within each column.
 * If the `pickerFormat` input is not provided then it will default to the `displayFormat`.
 *
 * In the following example, the display in the `<ion-datetime>` will use the
 * `MM/YYYY` format, such as `06/2020`. However, the picker interface
 * will display two columns with the month's long name, and the four-digit year.
 *
 * ```html
 * <ion-item>
 *   <ion-label>Date</ion-label>
 *   <ion-datetime displayFormat="MM/YYYY" pickerFormat="MMMM YYYY" [(ngModel)]="myDate"></ion-datetime>
 * </ion-item>
 * ```
 *
 * ### Datetime Data
 *
 * Historically, handling datetime values within JavaScript, or even within HTML
 * inputs, has always been a challenge. Specifically, JavaScript's `Date` object is
 * notoriously difficult to correctly parse apart datetime strings or to format
 * datetime values. Even worse is how different browsers and JavaScript versions
 * parse various datetime strings differently, especially per locale.
 *
 * But no worries, all is not lost! Ionic's datetime input has been designed so
 * developers can avoid the common pitfalls, allowing developers to easily format
 * datetime values within the input, and give the user a simple datetime picker for a
 * great user experience.
 *
 * ##### ISO 8601 Datetime Format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mmZ
 *
 * Ionic uses the [ISO 8601 datetime format](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime)
 * for its value. The value is simply a string, rather than using JavaScript's `Date`
 * object. Additionally, when using the ISO datetime format, it makes it easier
 * to serialize and pass within JSON objects, and sending databases a standardized
 * format which it can be easily parsed if need be.
 *
 * An ISO format can be used as a simple year, or just the hour and minute, or get more
 * detailed down to the millisecond and timezone. Any of the ISO formats below can be used,
 * and after a user selects a new value, Ionic will continue to use the same ISO format
 * which datetime value was originally given as.
 *
 * | Description          | Format                 | Datetime Value Example       |
 * |----------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
 * | Year                 | YYYY                   | 1994                         |
 * | Year and Month       | YYYY-MM                | 1994-12                      |
 * | Complete Date        | YYYY-MM-DD             | 1994-12-15                   |
 * | Date and Time        | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm       | 1994-12-15T13:47             |
 * | UTC Timezone         | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssTZD | 1994-12-15T13:47:20.789Z     |
 * | Timezone Offset      | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssTZD | 1994-12-15T13:47:20.789+5:00 |
 * | Hour and Minute      | HH:mm                  | 13:47                        |
 * | Hour, Minute, Second | HH:mm:ss               | 13:47:20                     |
 *
 * Note that the year is always four-digits, milliseconds (if it's added) is always
 * three-digits, and all others are always two-digits. So the number representing
 * January always has a leading zero, such as `01`. Additionally, the hour is always
 * in the 24-hour format, so `00` is `12am` on a 12-hour clock, `13` means `1pm`,
 * and `23` means `11pm`.
 *
 * It's also important to note that neither the `displayFormat` or `pickerFormat` can
 * set the datetime value's output, which is the value that is set by the component's
 * `ngModel`. The format's are merely for displaying the value as text and the picker's
 * interface, but the datetime's value is always persisted as a valid ISO 8601 datetime
 * string.
 *
 *
 * ## Min and Max Datetimes
 *
 * Dates are infinite in either direction, so for a user's selection there should be at
 * least some form of restricting the dates that can be selected. Be default, the maximum
 * date is to the end of the current year, and the minimum date is from the beginning
 * of the year that was 100 years ago.
 *
 * To customize the minimum and maximum datetime values, the `min` and `max` component
 * inputs can be provided which may make more sense for the app's use-case, rather
 * than the default of the last 100 years. Following the same IS0 8601 format listed
 * in the table above, each component can restrict which dates can be selected by the
 * user. Below is an example of restricting the date selection between the beginning
 * of 2016, and October 31st of 2020:
 *
 * ```html
 * <ion-item>
 *   <ion-label>Date</ion-label>
 *   <ion-datetime displayFormat="MMMM YYYY" min="2016" max="2020-10-31" [(ngModel)]="myDate">
 *   </ion-datetime>
 * </ion-item>
 * ```
 *
 *
 * ## Month Names and Day of the Week Names
 *
 * At this time, there is no one-size-fits-all standard to automatically choose the correct
 * language/spelling for a month name, or day of the week name, depending on the language
 * or locale. Good news is that there is an
 * [Intl.DateTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat)
 * standard which *most* browsers have adopted. However, at this time the standard has not
 * been fully implemented by all popular browsers so Ionic is unavailable to take advantage
 * of it *yet*. Additionally, Angular also provides an internationalization service, but it
 * is still under heavy development so Ionic does not depend on it at this time.
 *
 * All things considered, the by far easiest solution is to just provide an array of names
 * if the app needs to use names other than the default English version of month and day
 * names. The month names and day names can be either configured at the app level, or
 * individual `ion-datetime` level.
 *
 * ### App Config Level
 *
 * ```ts
 * //app.module.ts
 * @NgModule({
 * ...,
 * imports: [
 *   IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp, {
 *   monthNames: ['janeiro', 'fevereiro', 'mar\u00e7o', ... ],
 *   monthShortNames: ['jan', 'fev', 'mar', ... ],
 *   dayNames: ['domingo', 'segunda-feira', 'ter\u00e7a-feira', ... ],
 *   dayShortNames: ['dom', 'seg', 'ter', ... ],
 * })
 * ],
 * ...
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * ### Component Input Level
 *
 * ```html
 * <ion-item>
 *   <ion-label>Período</ion-label>
 *   <ion-datetime displayFormat="DDDD MMM D, YYYY" [(ngModel)]="myDate"
 *     monthNames="janeiro, fevereiro, mar\u00e7o, ..."
 *     monthShortNames="jan, fev, mar, ..."
 *     dayNames="domingo, segunda-feira, ter\u00e7a-feira, ..."
 *     dayShortNames="dom, seg, ter, ..."></ion-datetime>
 * </ion-item>
 * ```
 *
 *
 * ### Advanced Datetime Validation and Manipulation
 *
 * The datetime picker provides the simplicity of selecting an exact format, and persists
 * the datetime values as a string using the standardized
 * [ISO 8601 datetime format](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime).
 * However, it's important to note that `ion-datetime` does not attempt to solve all
 * situtations when validating and manipulating datetime values. If datetime values need
 * to be parsed from a certain format, or manipulated (such as adding 5 days to a date,
 * subtracting 30 minutes, etc.), or even formatting data to a specific locale, then we highly
 * recommend using [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) to "Parse, validate, manipulate, and
 * display dates in JavaScript". [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) has quickly become
 * our goto standard when dealing with datetimes within JavaScript, but Ionic does not
 * prepackage this dependency since most apps will not require it, and its locale
 * configuration should be decided by the end-developer.
 *
 *
 * @usage
 * ```html
 * <ion-item>
 *   <ion-label>Date</ion-label>
 *   <ion-datetime displayFormat="MM/DD/YYYY" [(ngModel)]="myDate">
 *   </ion-datetime>
 * </ion-item>
 * ```
