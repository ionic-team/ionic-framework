      A long time ago, in a galaxy far,
      far away....
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a period of civil war.
      Rebel spaceships, striking
      from a hidden base, have won
      their first victory against
      the evil Galactic Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the battle, rebel
      spies managed to steal secret
      plans to the Empire's
      ultimate weapon, the DEATH
      STAR, an armored space
      station with enough power to
      destroy an entire planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursued by the Empire's
      sinister agents, Princess
      Leia races home aboard her
      starship, custodian of the
      stolen plans that can save
      her people and restore
      freedom to the galaxy....
